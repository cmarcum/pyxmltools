# Detecting Machine-Generated Office Documents  
*A reference guide for identifying AI-, machine- or script-generated DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX files*

Machine-generated Office documents (from AI models, automation frameworks, or libraries like: [`python-docx`](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx), `python-pptx`, `openpyxl`, or programmatic ZIP construction) often have fingerprints that differ from files created interactively by human-users through Microsoft Office.

This guide describes the **telltale signs**, why they appear, and how to flag suspicious files.

## Understanding Office File Types  
Modern Microsoft Office formats:

- **DOCX** — WordprocessingML (Word)
- **XLSX** — SpreadsheetML (Excel)
- **PPTX** — PresentationML (PowerPoint)

All are **ZIP archives** containing XML parts that follow the **Office Open XML** (OOXML) standard. That is, while the document extensions are associated by the Windows Registry with M$Office programs, they are not true binaries and can be unpacked and viewed with simple tools. For 

# Telltale Signs of Machine-Generated DOCX Files

DOCX files generated by code (e.g., **python-docx**) differ measurably from those created manually in Microsoft Word.

Below are the most reliable detection heuristics.

## 1. Metadata Fingerprints (Core + App Properties)

Machine-generated documents frequently show unusual or missing values in:

- `docProps/core.xml`
- `docProps/app.xml`

### Typical Machine-Generated Patterns

| Field | Human-Created | Machine-Generated |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Creator** | Actual username | Empty, `"python-docx"`, `"LibreOffice"` |
| **LastModifiedBy** | Usually differs over time | Identical to creator or blank |
| **Timestamps** | Created ≠ Modified | Created == Modified (same second) |
| **Application** | `"Microsoft Office Word"` | `"python-docx"`, `"0.0.0.0"`, missing |
| **AppVersion** | Real version (e.g., `16.0000`) | Zeros, blanks, or bogus |

### Example of a machine-generated core.xml

```xml
<dc:creator>python-docx</dc:creator>
<cp:lastModifiedBy>python-docx</cp:lastModifiedBy>
